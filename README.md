# React Random Quote App

This repository contains the code for the React Advice App, as created in the corresponding video tutorial. The project involves building a React application that retrieves advice from the Advice Slip JSON API.

## Project Overview

In this project, we utilize React on the front end to create an interactive application that fetches advice from an external API. The application demonstrates the basic workflow of a React project and showcases how to make GET requests within React applications.
